# directive-restrict - disallow any other directive restrict than 'A' or 'E'

Not all directive restrictions may be desirable.
Also it might be desirable to define default restrictions, or explicitly not.
The default configuration limits the restrictions `AE` [Y074](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide#style-y074) and disallows explicitly specifying a default.
("directive-restrict": [0, {"restrict": "AE", "explicit": "never"}])
