# service-name - require and specify a prefix for all service names

All your services should have a name starting with the parameter you can define in your config object.
The second parameter can be a Regexp wrapped in quotes.
You can not prefix your services by "$" (reserved keyword for AngularJS services) ("service-name":  [2, "ng"]) [Y125](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide#style-y125)
